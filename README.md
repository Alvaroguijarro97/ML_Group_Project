# ML_Group_Project
Git Hub Repository for the Machine Learning group project.

**1. Introduction**

_In this section, describe what you are planning to do. Also, briefly describe related work._

_When discussing related work, do not forget to include appropriate references.  This is an example of a citation \cite{kim_convolutional_2014}. To format the citations properly, put the corresponding references into the bibliography.bib file. You can obtain BibTeX-formatted references for the "bib" file from Google Scholar (\url{https://scholar.google.com}), for example, by clicking on the double-quote character under a citation and then selecting, \mbox{"BibTeX"} as shown in Figure \ref{fig:google-scholar-1col} and Figure \ref{fig:google-scholar-2col}._

**3. Motivation**

Describe why your project is interesting. E.g., you can
describe why your project could have a broader societal im-
pact. Or, you may describe the motivation from a personal
learning perspective.

**4. Evaluation**

What would the successful outcome of your project look
like? In other words, under which circumstances would you
consider your project to be ‘successful’?
How do you measure success, specific to this project,
from a technical standpoint?

**5. Resources**

What resources are you going to use (datasets, computer hardware, computational tools, etc.)?

**6. Contributions**

You are expected to share the workload evenly, and every group member is expected to participate in both the experiments and writing. (As a group, you only need to submit one proposal and one report, though. So you need to work together and coordinate your efforts.)

Clearly indicate what computational and writing task each member of your group will be participating in.

## Abstract

European women face different abortion regimes, depending on their country of residence. Some countries have a more permissive approach to this issue and offer a safer environment to the women in need, but unfortunately, this is not the case everywhere \\cite{EAAP}. Due to that fact, women in many European countries leave their countries of residence and endure cross-border travels in order to obtain better conditions for an abortion in neighboring European countries. However, there is still little scientific understanding of these cross country abortion travels, starting with difficulties to even quantify the phenomenon.

The paper at hand aims to provide a pioneering approach on how to use machine learning models in order to estimate such abortion travels for the case of Germany. In the case of German States, distance to neighbouring countries, abortion policies in neighbouring countries, the fraction of the population with a migrant background, and the foreign population in the area could be some predictors to identify future pull factors for foreign abortion-seekers to come to Germany, for the procedure. In 2021, there were approximately 100,000 registered abortion procedures performed throughout the 16 federal states, with less than 1,000 registered to be from foreign women.

In the process of this research project, balanced and unbalanced Logistic Regression, Random Forrest, and Support Vector Machine classification models are fitted with a combined dataset in order to determine which one was the most accurate at predicting our variables of interest. Out of the three groups of examined variables, the models seem to suggest that the distance to other European countries has a higher incidence in the prediction of whether abortion was performed on a German or a foreign abortion-seeker in a German state.

## Introduction / Background

The introduction explains the problem, why it's difficult, interesting, or important, how and why current methods succeed/fail at the problem, and explains the key ideas of your approach and results. Though an introduction covers similar material as an abstract, the introduction gives more space for motivation, detail, references to existing work, and to capture the reader's interest.

## Related Work

This section helps the reader understand the research context of your work, by providing an overview of existing work in the area.

-   You might discuss: papers that inspired your approach, papers that you use as baselines, papers proposing alternative approaches to the problem, papers applying your methods to different tasks, etc.

-   This section shouldn't go into deep detail in any one paper (for example, there probably shouldn't be any equations) -- instead it should explain how the papers relate to each other, and how they relate to your work.

**See below for an example of how to cite related work in Markdown.**

Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) have proven successful in prior attempts to classify phrases and short texts [@devlin2018bert].

**Footnotes and Sidenotes**

You can use footnotes [^1] or sidenotes to elaborate on a concept throughout the paper.

## Proposed Method

This section details your approach(es) to the problem. For example, this is where you describe the architecture of your model, and any other key methods or algorithms.

-   You should be specific when describing your main approaches -- you probably want to include equations and figures.
-   You should also describe your baseline(s). Depending on space constraints, and how standard your baseline is, you might do this in detail, or simply refer the reader to some other paper for the details.
-   If any part of your approach is original, make it clear (so we can give you credit!). For models and techniques that aren't yours, provide references.
-   If you're using any code that you didn't write yourself, make it clear and provide a reference or link. When describing something you coded yourself, make it clear (so we can give you credit!).

**Below is an example of a figure:**

```{r fig1, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = '100%', fig.cap = "Model architecture"}
#knitr::include_graphics("figures/BERTfig3.png")
```

## Experiments

**Data**: Describe the dataset(s) you are using (provide references). If it's not already clear, make sure the associated task is clearly described.

**Software**: Briefly list (and cite) software you used.

**Hardware**: If relevant, list hardware resources you used.

**Evaluation method**: Describe the evaluation metric(s) you used, plus any other details necessary to understand your evaluation.

**Experimental details**: How you ran your experiments (e.g. model configurations, learning rate, training time, etc.)

**Results**: Report the quantitative results that you have found so far. Use a table or plot to compare multiple results and compare against baselines.

**Comment on quantitative results**: Are they what you expected? Better than you expected? Worse than you expected? Why do you think that is? What does this tell you about what you should do next? Including training curves might be useful to discuss whether things are training effectively.

***Note***: **Feel free to use some of the code from your project to explain your experiments. See example code block below.**

```{python bertcnn model parameters, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
OUTPUT_DIM = len(LABEL.vocab)
DROPOUT = 0.5
N_FILTERS = 100
FILTER_SIZES = [2,3]

model = BERTCNN(bert,
                OUTPUT_DIM,
                DROPOUT,
                N_FILTERS,
                FILTER_SIZES)
```

## Analysis

Your report should include some qualitative evaluation. That is, try to understand your system (how it works, when it succeeds and when it fails) by measuring or inspecting key characteristics or outputs of your model.

-   Types of qualitative evaluation include: commenting on selected examples, error analysis, measuring the performance metric for certain subsets of the data, ablation studies, comparing the behaviors of two systems beyond just the performance metric, and visualizing attention distributions or other activation heatmaps.

-   The Practical Tips lecture notes has a detailed section on qualitative evaluation -- you may find it useful to reread it.

## Conclusion(s)

Summarize the main findings of your project, and what you learned. Highlight your achievements, and note the primary limitations of your work. If you like, you can describe avenues for future work.

## Acknowledgments

List acknowledgments, if any. For example, if someone provided you a dataset, or you used someone else's resources, this is a good place to acknowledge the help or support you received.
